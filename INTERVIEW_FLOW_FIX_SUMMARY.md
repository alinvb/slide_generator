# 🔧 Enhanced Interview Flow - Context-Aware Conversation Management

## 🚨 Problem Identified

After comprehensive all-night testing of the Perfect JSON System, a critical regression was discovered in the chatbot's conversation flow and interview sequence management. The bot was:

- ❌ Asking repetitive questions (e.g., growth strategy question asked twice)
- ❌ Not maintaining context awareness between questions  
- ❌ Jumping inappropriately between topics without proper transitions
- ❌ Getting confused when users pointed out repetition ("you just asked this")
- ❌ Not following systematic 14-topic interview progression

## 🎯 Root Causes Analyzed

### 1. **Complex Topic Detection Logic**
- Overly complex keyword matching causing false topic completion
- Topics marked as "covered" after superficial mention
- Premature topic jumping without proper completion

### 2. **No Context Awareness** 
- System didn't track recent conversation context
- No detection of "you just asked this" responses
- No prevention of duplicate topic questions

### 3. **Missing Sequential Enforcement**
- 14-topic sequence existed but progression logic allowed jumping around
- No strict sequential order enforcement

### 4. **Research Flow Integration Issues**
- Research satisfaction checking interfered with systematic interview flow

## ✅ Comprehensive Solutions Implemented

### 🎯 **Enhanced Context Awareness System**

#### **Recent Question Tracking**
```python
# Extract recent AI questions and user responses for context awareness
for i, msg in enumerate(messages[-10:]):  # Only look at last 10 messages
    if msg["role"] == "assistant" and "?" in msg["content"]:
        # Extract the actual question from AI response
        if "let's discuss" in content.lower() or "now let's" in content.lower():
            recent_questions.append(content.lower())
```

#### **Repetition Complaint Detection**
```python
# Check for "you just asked this" or repetition complaints
user_indicated_repetition = False
repetition_indicators = [
    "you just asked", "already asked", "you asked this", "just discussed", 
    "we covered this", "repeat", "again", "duplicate", "same question"
]
```

### 🔄 **Sequential Topic Enforcement**

#### **Structured 14-Topic Framework**
```python
# Each topic now has position, interview_question, and context tracking
"business_overview": {
    "position": 1,
    "interview_question": "What is your company name and give me a brief overview of what your business does?",
    "topic_keywords": ["company", "business", "overview", "operations"],
    "substantial_keywords": ["founded", "headquarters", "industry", "employees"],
    "covered": False,
    "asked_recently": False,
    # ... rest of topic definition
}
```

#### **Position-Based Progression**
```python
# Sort topics by position to enforce sequential order
sorted_topics = sorted(topics_checklist.items(), key=lambda x: x[1]["position"])

for topic_name, topic_info in sorted_topics:
    if not topic_info["covered"] and not topic_info["skipped"]:
        # CONTEXT AWARENESS: Check if this question was asked recently
        if topic_info["asked_recently"]:
            if user_indicated_repetition:
                # Skip and move to next
                continue
            else:
                # Provide clarification
                next_question = f"I understand we touched on this briefly. Let me be more specific: {topic_info['interview_question']}"
```

### 🤖 **Context-Aware Response Generation**

#### **Enhanced Interview Response Function**
```python
def get_enhanced_interview_response(messages, user_message, model, api_key, service):
    """ENHANCED: Get AI response with context awareness and repetition prevention"""
    
    # Check for context-aware response first
    context_response = get_context_aware_response(messages, user_message)
    if context_response:
        return context_response
    
    # Check progress and provide structured next question if needed
    progress_info = analyze_conversation_progress(messages)
    
    # Auto-progression for brief confirmatory responses
    brief_responses = ["yes", "ok", "good", "correct", "right", "sure", "proceed"]
    if (user_message.lower().strip() in brief_responses and 
        progress_info["next_question"] and 
        not progress_info["is_complete"]):
        return progress_info["next_question"]
```

#### **Intelligent Repetition Handling**
```python
def get_context_aware_response(messages, user_message):
    """Generate context-aware responses that prevent repetition"""
    
    repetition_complaints = [
        "you just asked", "already asked", "you asked this", "just discussed", 
        "we covered this", "repeat", "again", "duplicate", "same question"
    ]
    
    if any(complaint in user_message.lower() for complaint in repetition_complaints):
        # Acknowledge and move forward
        progress = analyze_conversation_progress(messages)
        if progress["next_question"]:
            return f"You're absolutely right, I apologize for the repetition. Let me move forward. {progress['next_question']}"
```

### 📊 **Simplified Coverage Logic**

#### **Reliable Topic Detection**
```python
# SIMPLE COVERAGE LOGIC: Need topic keywords + substantial keywords 
basic_coverage = len(topic_keywords_found) >= 2 and len(substantial_keywords_found) >= 2

# OR: Extensive discussion detected
extensive_discussion = len(topic_keywords_found) >= 3 and len(substantial_keywords_found) >= 1

# OR: Research response with topic keywords
research_coverage = has_research and len(topic_keywords_found) >= 2

# Mark as covered if any condition met
is_covered = basic_coverage or extensive_discussion or research_coverage
```

### 🎯 **Enhanced System Prompts**

#### **Updated Investment Banker Rules**
```
🚨 CRITICAL INTERVIEW RULES - CONTEXT AWARENESS:
- ASK ONE TOPIC AT A TIME - Never ask multiple topics together
- 🚨 CONTEXT AWARENESS: Check recent conversation before asking questions
- If user says "you just asked this" or "we covered this" - apologize and move to NEXT topic immediately
- NEVER repeat the same question twice - check conversation history first
- Follow STRICT SEQUENTIAL ORDER: Topic 1 → Topic 2 → Topic 3... → Topic 14
```

## 🧪 **Comprehensive Testing Results**

### **Test Case 1: Normal Progression** ✅
- Topics covered: 0 → Sequential progression working
- Next topic: business_overview (position 1) → Correct ordering
- Context aware: True → Enhanced system active

### **Test Case 2: Repetition Complaint** ✅ 
- User complaint detected: "you just asked this question about growth strategy"
- Context-aware response generated: "You're absolutely right, I apologize for the repetition..."
- Repetition prevention active: System detected recently asked questions

### **Test Case 3: Sequential Enforcement** ✅
- Sequential progression working: Proper 1→2→3→4 topic order
- Next topic correctly identified: management_team after financial performance

### **Test Case 4: Coverage Detection** ✅
- Improved coverage logic working with topic + substantial keywords
- Research responses properly detected and validated
