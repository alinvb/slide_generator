❗ REMAINING ISSUES (7):
  • Several required top-level fields are missing or empty, including 'facts', 'strategic_buyers', 'product_service_data', 'competitive_analysis', 'sea_conglomerates', and 'margin_cost_data'.
  • 'facts' is present but completely empty, which fails both completeness and content quality criteria.
  • Data types for 'business_overview_data.timeline' (should be object with 'start_year'/'end_year'), 'growth_strategy_data.strategies' (should be nested under 'growth_strategy'), and 'growth_strategy_data.key_assumptions' (should be object, not array) do not match the template.
  • Empty objects for several fields (e.g., 'sea_conglomerates', 'margin_cost_data') reduce content quality and completeness.
  • Arrays such as 'charts' are present but not part of the template, indicating structural inconsistency.

✅ API VALIDATION FEEDBACK:
  • Professional language and terminology are used throughout most populated fields, meeting investment banking standards.
  • Management team profiles are detailed and well-structured, with clear roles and experience bullets.
  • Valuation data is presented with appropriate methodologies and context, reflecting industry norms.

🔧 NEXT STEPS:
  • Populate all required fields with relevant, non-empty data, especially 'facts', 'strategic_buyers', 'product_service_data', 'competitive_analysis', 'sea_conglomerates', and 'margin_cost_data'.
  • Correct data types to match the template: use objects for timelines and key assumptions, and nest strategies under a 'growth_strategy' object.
  • Remove or properly integrate non-template fields such as 'charts' to maintain structural consistency.

❗ REMAINING ISSUES (6):
  • Several required slides from the template are missing, including investor considerations, product/service footprint, historical financials, competitive positioning, margin/cost resilience, global conglomerates, strategic buyer profiles, and investor process overview.
  • The 'buyer_profiles' slide is present only for 'financial_buyers', not for 'strategic_buyers' as in the template.
  • The 'buyer_profiles.data.table_headers' for financial buyers includes 'Financial Capacity', which is not present in the template for either buyer profile type, indicating a schema inconsistency.
  • No empty fields detected, but the absence of entire sections constitutes a major completeness issue.
  • The number of slides is much lower than the template (6 vs. 14), indicating incomplete coverage.

✅ API VALIDATION FEEDBACK:
  • JSON syntax is valid and well-structured, with correct use of arrays and objects.
  • Content quality is high for the included sections, with professional language and relevant data for Databricks.

  • Ensure that all slide objects follow the template structure, including required fields and correct data types.
  • Align 'buyer_profiles' table headers with the template for both strategic and financial buyers; avoid introducing new fields unless justified and documented.
