        Financial buyers include Vista Equity Partners (they know SaaS well) and Thoma Bravo

        Management team has CEO Sarah Kim (ex-Oracle), CTO John Davis (MIT PhD), and

        Revenue is $40M with 35% growth, EBITDA margins around 28%. Main competitors are 
        Snowflake and Databricks. Precedent transaction was Looker selling to Google for $2.6B.
