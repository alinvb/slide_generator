"""
Test Smart Selective Rendering System
=====================================
Tests that the application generates slides only for topics the user actually discussed,
as per the requirement: "if the user only answers 3 questions then the render plan should only have those 3 topics."

This test simulates a conversation where a user discusses only:
1. Business overview (company name + basic info)
2. Management team (leadership details)
3. Financial performance (revenue, profitability)

Expected result: Only these 3 slides should be in the render plan.
