    User: "Let's analyze DataFlow Analytics for potential acquisition. Here's what I know:
    
    BUSINESS: DataFlow is a $50M revenue SaaS company providing real-time analytics 
    to enterprise clients. They process 10TB of data daily and serve 200+ Fortune 500 clients.
    Main products are their Analytics Platform ($30M revenue) and Custom Insights service ($20M revenue).
    
    FINANCIALS: 2024 revenue $50M (+40% YoY), 2023 was $35M, 2022 was $25M. 
    EBITDA margins are 25% so about $12.5M EBITDA in 2024. Growing at 40% annually.
    
    MANAGEMENT: CEO Sarah Chen (ex-Salesforce VP, 15 years experience), 
    CTO Mike Rodriguez (PhD Stanford, built the core platform), 
    CFO Jennifer Liu (former Goldman Sachs, joined 2 years ago).
    
    GROWTH STRATEGY: Expanding to European markets Q2 2025, launching AI-powered 
    predictive analytics module Q1 2025. Also acquiring smaller competitors - 
    just bought InsightCorp for $8M last month.
    
    COMPETITIVE POSITION: Beats Tableau and Power BI on real-time processing speed.
    Main competitors are Palantir (enterprise), Snowflake (data warehouse), and Databricks.
    Key differentiator is 10x faster query processing and white-label options.
    
    STRATEGIC BUYERS: Microsoft would pay 15-20x revenue ($750M-$1B) for Azure integration.
    Salesforce interested for CRM analytics at 12-15x ($600-750M). 
    Oracle could pay 18x ($900M) to compete with Snowflake.
    
    FINANCIAL BUYERS: Vista Equity Partners knows this space well, they own Tibco.
    Thoma Bravo has been calling - they love SaaS with 25%+ EBITDA margins.
    KKR's tech team reached out through intermediaries.
    
    PRECEDENT TRANSACTIONS: Looker sold to Google for $2.6B at 20x revenue.
    Tableau went to Salesforce for $15.7B at 17x revenue. 
    Qlik sold to Thoma Bravo for $3B at 12x revenue in 2016.
    
    INVESTMENT THESIS: Sticky enterprise customers (98% retention), recurring revenue,
    40% growth with expanding margins. Market growing 25% annually, $50B TAM.
    
    RISKS: Customer concentration (top 10 clients = 45% revenue), 
    competition from Microsoft/Google, talent retention in tight market.
    
    VALUATION: Looking for 15-18x revenue multiple given growth and margins.
    Comps suggest $750M-$900M range. Management owns 40%, VC owns 35%.
    
    DEAL STRUCTURE: Prefer cash deal, management rollover 10-15%, 
    18-month earnout for international expansion targets."
